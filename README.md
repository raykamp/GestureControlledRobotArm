## What?
This project explores human controlled robotics. A robotic arm is controlled in real-time using 5 finger gestures on a force-sensitive touch interface. 

## Why?
This project was created for two reasons: First, is to evaluate Sensel’s new force-sensitive touch interface. Second, is the exploration of a magical sensation; The use of touch gestures to animate a robot.

## How?
There are 4 hand gestures that control the robot arm’s movements: 

Force down:

Rotation:

## Me too?
To make this project happen, the following items were used:
* Sensel touch interface ([http://www.sensel.com/](http://www.sensel.com/))
* MeArm robot arm ([http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:360108](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:360108))
* Arduino Uno ([https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021))
* Servo “shield” for Arduino ([http://www.sainsmart.com/sainsmart-sensor-shield-v5-4-arduino-apc220-bluetooth-analog-module-servo-motor.html](http://www.sainsmart.com/sainsmart-sensor-shield-v5-4-arduino-apc220-bluetooth-analog-module-servo-motor.html)
 

You can get this project up and running in no time! The code is located here: 
https://github.com/raykamp/GestureControlledRobotArm

First, program the Arduino with the “sketch” code. Next, run the Processing application, and control the robot with 5 fingers!
